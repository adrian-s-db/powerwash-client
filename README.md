## Powerwash
Powerwash is a mobile app helping people make better decisions about their energy use. The app allows users to scan the energy efficiency QR codes on their washing machine to find the hourly cost of running them. With this information in their hands, consumers can save money and develop more rational and sustainable energy consumption patterns, which is especially important nowadays due to the climate and energy crises. 


This repo corresponds to the final User app of the project. It can be used together with is other repo:
* [Powerwash API](https://github.com/adrian-s-db/powerwash-api) - API that connects the app with the database and handles requests.
